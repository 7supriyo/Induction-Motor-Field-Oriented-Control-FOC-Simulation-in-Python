# Induction-Motor-Field-Oriented-Control-FOC-Simulation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python simulation of Field Oriented Control (FOC) for a squirrel cage induction motor. FOC (also known as Vector Control) is an advanced control technique used to achieve decoupled control of the motor's torque and flux
