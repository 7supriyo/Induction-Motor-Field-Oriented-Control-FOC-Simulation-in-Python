# Induction Motor Field Oriented Control (FOC) Simulation in Python

This repository contains a Python simulation of **Field Oriented Control (FOC)** for a squirrel cage induction motor. FOC, also known as **Vector Control**, is an advanced control technique widely used to achieve decoupled control of the motor's torque and flux. The simulation is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and is compatible with Google Colab for easy accessibility.

## Features

- **Field Oriented Control (FOC)** simulation for a squirrel cage induction motor.
- Decoupled control of torque and flux, enhancing motor performance.
- Implementation in a single, well-documented Jupyter Notebook for simplicity.
- Fully compatible with **Google Colab** for cloud-based execution.

## Files in the Repository

- `Python_simulation_project_for_Field_Oriented_Control_(FOC)_of_an_Induction_Motor_.ipynb`: The main simulation notebook.
- `LICENSE`: License file for the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the simulation, ensure you have the following:

- **Google Colab** account (or Jupyter Notebook installed locally).
- Python libraries such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`. These are already pre-installed in Google Colab.

### Running the Simulation in Google Colab

1. Open the repository in GitHub: [Induction Motor FOC Simulation](https://github.com/7supriyo/Induction-Motor-Field-Oriented-Control-FOC-Simulation-in-Python).
2. Click on the `Python_simulation_project_for_Field_Oriented_Control_(FOC)_of_an_Induction_Motor_.ipynb` file.
3. Click on the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the simulation.

### Outputs

The simulation generates:

- Graphs showing torque and flux control performance.
- Motor speed and current waveforms.
- Clear visualizations of FOC's decoupling mechanism.

## Applications

Field Oriented Control (FOC) is widely used in:

- Industrial motor drives
- Electric vehicles (EVs)
- Robotics
- HVAC systems
